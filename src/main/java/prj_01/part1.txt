Q: What can you observe from the printouts of the threads on the terminal?
 When it prints out the threads for step 1 (-s 1), first I see the program starting,
 since it prints out "Starting Program...". Next, it starts to create the threads from
 Thread 1 to Thread 5 and prints it out. After it is done, it prints out "Main Finished ...
 Bye Bye". After it prints out that the Main has finished running, it starts to run the
 Threads, printing "Running Thread... This is thread n" 5 times, where n represents a
 number from 0 to 4, although not in order.
